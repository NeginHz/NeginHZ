## 🔥 About Me
I’m an **Applied AI Engineer** with an engineering background, experienced in building **reliable, production-oriented machine learning systems** across the full lifecycle — from data preprocessing and modeling to deployment and monitoring.

I focus on **real-world AI systems**, not just experimental notebooks.

**What I enjoy building:**
- Production-ready ML pipelines & REST APIs  
- Real-time anomaly detection & monitoring systems  
- NLP pipelines with strong generalization  
- Computer vision systems (YOLOv8 + tracking)  
- MLOps & cloud infrastructure (Docker, Terraform, AWS)  
- Clean, modular, testable Python code
